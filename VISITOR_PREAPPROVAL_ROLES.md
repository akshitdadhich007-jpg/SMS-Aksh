→ Visitor CANNOT enter yet
→ Tell visitor to come back later
→ Or ask resident for earlier approval
```

**🔴 EXPIRED** (Red)
```
✗ Approval Expired
"Approval expired 20 minutes ago"

→ Visitor CANNOT enter without resident's permission
→ Call resident to extend approval
→ Or create new approval
→ **Note:** You can still mark entry with supervisor approval
```

#### 5. **Mark Entry**

```
If time window is VALID (green):

1. Click "Mark Entry" button
2. Timestamp recorded automatically

4. No resident call needed!
5. "Mark Exit" button appears
```

**What Gets Recorded:**

6. History complete
```

**What Gets Recorded:**

### Important Rules

**MUST FOLLOW:**
✅ Always search for approval code first
✅ Verify visitor details match person
✅ Check time window is VALID (not EXPIRED)
✅ Only allow entry if VALID or with supervisor approval
✅ Mark exit when visitor leaves
✅ Maintain professional conduct

**DON'T FORGET:**
❌ Never let visitor without valid approval enter
❌ Don't skip time window check
❌ Don't forget to mark exit
❌ Don't share approval codes with others

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Visitor with Valid Approval**
```
Visitor: "My code is VPA000001"
You: Search for VPA000001
Result: ✓ VALID (30 minutes remaining)
Action: Mark Entry ✓
Visitor enters compound
```

**Scenario 2: Visitor Arriving Early**
```
Visitor: "My approval is VPA000002"
You: Search for VPA000002
Result: ⚠️ UPCOMING (starts in 45 minutes)
Action: Tell visitor "Come back at 10:00 AM"
Or: Contact resident for early approval
```

**Scenario 3: Approval Expired**
```
Visitor: "My code is VPA000003"
You: Search for VPA000003
Result: ✗ EXPIRED (20 minutes ago)
Action: Call resident for extension
If approved: Mark Entry
If denied: Don't allow entry
```

**Scenario 4: Multiple Visitors from Same Person**
```
Mobile: 9876543210
Result: Shows 3 approvals on different dates
You: Check date matches today
Then: Proceed with correct approval
Note: Admin sees multiple same-day visits (fraud check)
```

### Pre-Approved Visitors List

**View all waiting visitors:**
```
Section: "All Pre-Approved Visitors"

Shows:
- Code, Name, Mobile
- Date, Time
- Entry/Exit status
- Flat number

Sorted by date (today's first)

Click any visitor to verify details
```

### Time Window Guide

**Understanding the Window:**
```
Approval Time: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM

- 9:30 AM: ⚠️ UPCOMING (not yet)
- 10:00 AM: ✓ VALID (can enter)
- 10:30 AM: ✓ VALID (still within window)
- 11:30 AM: ✓ VALID (15 minutes left)
- 12:00 PM: ✗ EXPIRED (window closed)
- 12:30 PM: ✗ EXPIRED (30 minutes over)
```

**Decision Logic:**
```
Current time within start-end window?
  ↓
YES → ✓ VALID → Can enter
  ↓
NO → Check:
     - Before start? ⚠️ UPCOMING → Too early
     - After end? ✗ EXPIRED → Too late
```

### Dealing with Problems

**"I don't have approval code"**
- Ask for mobile number instead
- Search by 10-digit mobile
- Show them matching approval
- Proceed with verification

**"Approval is expired but they say resident approved"**
- Call resident to confirm
- Get resident permission
- Note it in system (if supervisor allows)
- Mark entry with flag

**"Visitor is not in system"**
- Tell them to call resident
- Resident must create approval immediately
- Only allow entry after verification
- Or ask visitor to wait

**"Data shows multiple visits from same phone today"**
- Verify each visitor separately
- Check details match
- Admin will review for suspicious activity

### Tips for Fast Processing

1. **Get Code First**
   - Ask "Do you have an approval code?"
   - Faster than searching by mobile

2. **Verify Visually**
   - Match name and vehicle
   - Reduces confusion

3. **Use Copy Buttons**
   - Use mobile number copy for searching
   - Reduces typing errors

4. **Keep List Handy**
   - Check "All Pre-Approved Visitors" when quiet
   - Know who's expected

5. **Mark Times Accurately**
   - Mark entry/exit immediately
   - Don't guess times

### Your Report (Admin Sees)

Your work is tracked:
```
Admin dashboard shows:
- All entries/exits you recorded
- Accuracy of time records
- Visitors processed
- Suspicious activities
- Your performance
```

**Be accurate** - Admin reviews your work for:
✓ Correct time records
✓ Proper verification
✓ Security protocols followed
✓ Fraud prevention

### Security Tips

1. **Verify ID**
   - Ask for ID before marking entry
   - Ensures right person

2. **Check Vehicle**
   - Visitor with vehicle approval
   - Vehicle should match code
   - Report mismatches to supervisor

3. **Time Protection**
   - Don't override expired approvals easily
   - Report repeated violations
   - Alert supervisor to fraud attempts

4. **Stay Aware**
   - Multiple same-phone visitors in day = Alert
   - Same visitor arriving late repeatedly = Report
   - Check admin for suspicious activities

## 📊 ADMIN GUIDE - Monitoring & Analytics

### Your Role
Monitor all visitor activity, detect suspicious patterns, and generate security reports.

### Access Analytics Dashboard

```
Admin Dashboard
  ↓
Click "📊 Visitor Analytics" in sidebar
  ↓
Full visitor analytics appear
```

### Key Metrics (6 Numbers)

**1. Total Approvals**
```
Total pre-approvals created
Includes: Approved, Expired, Cancelled

Example: 245 total approvals this month
```

**2. Entries Completed**
```
Pre-approvals where visitor actually entered

Example: 198 visitors actually came (out of 245)
```

**3. Conversion Rate**
```
Percentage of approvals that resulted in visits
Formula: Entries Completed / Total Approvals × 100

Example: 80% (198/245)
Normal: 75-85%
Below 70%: May indicate issues
Above 90%: Unusually high
```

**4. Average Stay Time**
```
Average duration visitors spend in compound
Formula: Sum of all stay durations / Number of visits

Example: 45 minutes average stay
Meeting: 30-60 minutes typical
Delivery: 5-15 minutes typical
Repair: 60-180 minutes typical
```

**5. Approved Count**
```
Approvals still valid/not expired

Example: 23 active approvals waiting
```

**6. Cancelled Count**
```
Approvals cancelled by residents

Example: 24 cancellations
High number: May indicate issues with residents

Important: Why are residents cancelling?
- Visitor couldn't come? Normal
- Too many cancellations? Resident concern
```

### Date Range Filtering

**Three Options:**

**Last 30 Days**
- Current month analytics
- Recent trends
- Use for weekly reports

**Last 90 Days**
- Quarterly analysis
- Seasonal patterns
- 3-month trend

### Suspicious Activities

**Three Types of Alerts:**

**🔴 ALERT TYPE 1: Multiple Visitors from Same Phone (Same Day)**
```
Mobile: 9876543210

Violations:
- Feb 14: 4 different visitors from same phone
- Feb 15: 3 different visitors from same phone

Suspicious because:
- Same person with multiple identities?
- Phone shared among group?
- Possible vendor unauthorized access?

Action:
1. Contact resident at that flat
2. Ask why multiple visitors from same number
3. Flag for follow-up
4. Monitor future patterns
```

**🟠 ALERT TYPE 2: Entry Outside Approval Window**
```
Approval Code: VPA000001
Approved Time: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
Actual Entry: 12:45 PM (45 minutes AFTER window)

Why this matters:
- Visitor arrived late - approval already expired
- Security allowed entry despite expired approval
- Could be bending rules OR emergency

Action:
1. Check if supervisor override was given
2. Note time discrepancy
3. Monitor resident for repeated late entries
4. Flag pattern if happens often
```

**🟠 ALERT TYPE 3: Extended Stay (2+ Hours Past Approval)**
```
Approval Code: VPA000002
Approved Time: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (2-hour window)
Actual Exit: 2:30 PM (2.5 HOURS AFTER window)

Why this matters:
- Visitor stayed 2.5 hours longer than approved
- Possible unauthorized activity
- Or approval window was too short

Action:
1. Check resident and visitor relationship
2. Determine if intentional (resident aware) or not
3. Monitor for repeated extensions
4. Provide residents with guidance on proper time windows
```

**Understanding the Color Code:**
```
🔴 Red Alert: Critical - Multiple issues
🟠 Orange Alert: Warning - Check this
```

### Detailed Analysis

**For Each Alert, Show:**
- Visitor name
- Resident name
- What rule was violated
- How much was violated
- Pattern (first time or repeated?)

**Decision Tree:**
```
One-time violation?
  ↓ YES → Document, monitor
  ↓ NO → Investigate pattern

Seems honest/emergency?
  ↓ YES → Issue guidance
  ↓ NO → Escalate to security

Repeated issue with same resident?
  ↓ YES → Meeting with resident
  ↓ NO → Monitor
```
